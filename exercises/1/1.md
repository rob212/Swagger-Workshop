# Exercise 1 

Using the Swagger-UI interface test that our API can successfully return a specific book:

1. Retrieve the book with an id of 2 using the GET `/book/{bookId}` endpoint.
2. Check that the JSON we are returned contains the author value of "James A. Whittaker" and the title is "How Google Tests Software"

## Edge cases 

- What happens if you provide an id of a book that isn't in our database? Is the response you receive what you expected?
- What happens if you attempt to retrieve a specific book without providing it's id? 
- What happens if you provide input in an unexpected form, e.g. passing in a string rather than an integer for the id?
