# Exercise 3

Using the Swagger-UI interface test that our API can successfully add a book to our database:

1. Add a new book using the POST `/book` endpoint. 
 >The *basic authorization* credentials for doing so are *username* = `admin` and *password* = `secret`

2. Check that your POST request worked via the GET `/books` endpoint or directly in the `database/db.json` file.
  

## Edge cases 

- What happens if you provide invalid JSON in the body of the request? 
- What happens if the data type of one of the properties you provide in the request body is of the wrong type. E.g. providing a integer number instead of a string?
- Can you create duplicate books? Is the current behaviour desired?
