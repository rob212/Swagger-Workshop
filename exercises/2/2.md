# Exercise 2

Using the Swagger-UI interface test that our API can successfully return all the books in our database:

1. Retrieve all of the books using the GET `/books` endpoint.
2. Check that the JSON we are returned contains a list of all the books in our database. 
  

## Edge cases 

- This endpoint doesn't use any parameters so there isn't much scope for varying input. However, you may have uncovered two books with the same id in the database. What happens if you try and search for this id individually? 
- Does the current behaviour have any consequences? 
- Can you retrieve the book written by "Jeff Sutherland" via the API?
